        <p>To the Esteemed Members of the Republican Party,</p>

        <p>We, the Dead Revolutionaries of History, have gathered in our ethereal committee to discuss recent events on Earth—particularly the so-called "insurrection" on January 6th. We must admit, the reports have left us in a state of confusion. You see, revolutions, as we knew them, were serious business. They involved actual planning, strategies, and, dare we say it, weapons.</p>

        <p>Guns, for example, are typically involved. We're not entirely sure how you intended to overthrow anything while armed primarily with flags, smartphones, and a healthy dose of grievances. While we appreciate a good protest as much as anyone, calling this a "revolution" feels a bit like calling a food fight a war.</p>

        <p>And let’s talk about your entourage—grandmothers? Listen, we're all for multigenerational participation, but when it comes to revolutions, perhaps it's best to leave Nana at home. There’s no need to risk her knitting needles or her patience on the front lines.</p>

        <p>Then there’s the matter of your message. If you were truly hoping to rally the disenfranchised masses, it might have been wise not to alienate potential allies at every turn. Black Lives Matter, the Far Left, and Libertarians have been just as disillusioned with the system as you are. A revolution is supposed to unite the discontented, not drive them away by threatening their livelihoods or deporting them for not funding wars they don’t support.</p>

        <p>We’re not under any illusions here—we know that many conservatives don’t love these groups any more than they’re loved in return. But let’s face it, the country is vast, and it’s unlikely to stay in one piece if things ever get truly heated. Consider this: the Black Panthers, one of the great militias of America, were a formidable force until Ronald Reagan—yes, your beloved conservative icon—decided to outlaw open carry of firearms in California. Imagine if they ended up running California today. Would that really affect your lives so much? Probably not, because, frankly, you wouldn’t be caught dead in California anyway.</p>

        <p>And as for Black Lives Matter, let’s just say that if those protests had been armed, they might not have felt compelled to set things on fire just to get people’s attention. Armed protests tend to have a way of making people sit up and listen—without the need for a match.</p>

        <p>The same logic applies to New Hampshire—Libertarian Homeland. If those “Live Free or Die” folks up there decided to turn the Granite State into a libertarian utopia, would it really be your problem? Let them have their freedom, their pot, and their guns. It’s not like you’re planning to vacation in the White Mountains while they’re busy reading Ayn Rand under the stars.</p>

        <p>Now, we hear some of you complaining that the systems these potential allies have proposed might not work. Communism, for example—you argue—would lead to starvation and ruin. Well, we have to tell you, even some of our members, notably Stalin, Marx, and Pol Pot, suggest that this is not, in practice, a problem. Sure, millions might starve, but hey, that’s just a detail, right? Either way, it’s not skin off your backs. Just reclaim the land when they’re done with it, or better yet, trade them food in return for some decent musicians and comedians. Who knows? You might finally get a good laugh out of the deal.</p>

        <p>And then there’s your stance on abortion and trans issues. We can't help but notice that forcing your enemies to stay fertile and breed doesn't exactly scream 'serious about revolution.' If anything, it suggests you're more interested in making sure there’s a next generation of people to disagree with you. Is it really a revolution if your plan involves ensuring that those you despise keep producing more of themselves? We have to wonder if you’re planning a revolution or just trying to maintain a steady supply of people to argue with on social media.</p>

        <p>Instead of picking fights with those who might actually share your disdain for the current regime, wouldn’t it be wiser to recognize that there’s room for multiple revolutions in this great, big country? You don’t all have to love each other, but you could at least stop trying to out-oppress one another. If the end goal is freedom, maybe it’s time to stop getting in each other’s way.</p>
