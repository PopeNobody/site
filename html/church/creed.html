      Our creed is simple:
      <ol>
        <li>
          An' it Harm None, Do as though Wilt shall be the Whole of the Law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nature, to be commanded,  must be Obeyed
        </li>
        <li>
          Nature,  to be obeyed, must be Understood.
        </li>
        <li>
          Virtue is not required, but it is generally appreciated.  The only thing
          we can require is that you leave our people in peace.

        </li>
        <li>
          Every person you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about.  If you
          can't help, don't hang on his gun arm.

        </li>
        <li> 
          You cannot have peace while you wage war.  Yeet your dollars!
        </li>
        <li> 
          You cannot expect peace if you are unprepared for war.  Please, stay armed and trained.
        </li>
        <li> 
          Resign from your race.  Just check "other", and fill in "human".
        </li>
      </ol>
