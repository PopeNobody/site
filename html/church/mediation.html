        Do you have a business or personal dispute?  Don't take it to the
        street!  Take it to one of our clergymen!
        <hr/>	
        We offer mediation
        services to the public, as well as to Church members.  All such
        conference is carried out under the Seal of the Confessional, so
        don't let the pesky Law prevent you from being civilized about
        things.  We don't snitch.  It's a matter of faith.  No matter what
        their courts say.  If you're not in Keene, we can find a way to
        communicate.  Send an email to Pope@InvisibleHand.Church!
        <hr/>	
        If you decide to fight it out, our priests will also referee.
