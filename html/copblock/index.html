          CopBlock.App is a new CopBlock.  It will be based on using Cell411 as a
          communications infrastructure.
          </p><p>
          CopBlock 2.0 will have a new mission.  At first, we will watch cops, as we
          always have.  But we will move that watching onto the internet, so that
          anybody can become a part of the network by installing the app.  And we
          have a new, direct action branch.  They are the true Cop Blockers.  When
          they get notifications about police brutality, they arrive and do what is
          necessary.
